| **Risk** | **Description** | **Risk Management Strategy** |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Due to our unfamiliarity with art therapy, we may misunderstand the project requirements, causing discrepancies between module settings and client expectations. | • We can only understand the overall process of art therapy through reading literature and client descriptions. There may be deviations from her expectations in module design, leading to suboptimal results. <br>• At present, we do not have enough samples to determine the specific needs and expectations of users, and we have limited channels to obtain sample information, and there is no guarantee that we can obtain enough sample size to improve the confidence of results. | • Increase communication frequency with client to comprehensively understand their needs and in the communication with client as much as possible to obtain information that can be used as a reference to decide development direction precisely. <br>• Develop a prototype for a specific type of psychological therapy as early as possible, providing client with a tangible demonstration to intuitively experience the effectiveness of combining art therapy with the app. |
| Failure to allocate developing plans properly. | • Failure to prioritize features and designing too many functionalities. This will lead to the project content may become complicated, and the customer will not understand the gist and core of the product. | • To mitigate this, clear time planning should be done in the early stages of the project. Estimate the time required for implementing different functional modules, understanding user needs, specifying essential core functionalities as well as additional features. <br>• Make sure to achieve an MVP as the primary goal. Each MVP is the foundation of a phase, and further extensions should build on the current phase's MVP. |
| The use of mobile devices as platforms has certain limitations. | Accept <br> • The project will involve functionalities such as painting and collage. However, due to the project's presentation as an app, the user experience may be compromised due to the difficulty of operating on a portable devices, leading to a reduction in the target audience. | • The project team is aware of the possible consequences of this risk, but the advantages of portability and availability offered by portable devices should be prioritized. |
